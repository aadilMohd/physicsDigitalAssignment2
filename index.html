                        <p>Batteries and capacitors are the most important energy storage devices we use and carbon nanotubes 
                            can help us here as well.CNTs have intrinsic properties which can be the materials for the use as 
                            electrodes in capacitors and batteries. The properties of CNTs which will be useful are good electrical
                             conductivity , high surface area , and most importantly its linear geometry which makes their surface very 
                             accessible for the electrolyte.Research has demonstrated that CNTs have the highest reversible capacity of 
                             any carbon material for use in lithium-ion batteries. Moreover, CNTs are excellent materials for supercapacitor 
                             electrodes.CNTs can also be used for fuel cell components. The properties like high thermal conductivity 
                             and surface area will be helpful in PEM fuel cells. Because of its high electrical conductivity, it can 
                             be used in gas diffusion layers.As CNTs are hard and has high strength so it can be used as a part of 
                             composite components in fuel cells which are used in transport applications.
